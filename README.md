<h1>Adventure-works-dashboard</h1> 
<p>This data set was imported from my Adventureworks [2019] database in SQL Server. Adventureworks is a free publicly available database for a fictional bike company created by Microsoft.

Below is simply a sample of the data. The entire database is quite large and for this dashboard only details relating to sales and staff were targeted.</p>
